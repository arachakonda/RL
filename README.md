# Big Ideas

- **Sequential Decision Making** : K-Arm-Bandit Problem, time-steps, actions, rewards, values, incremental update rule, general update rule, Exploration Vs Exploitation
- **Markov Decision Process**: Discounted Rewards, Episodic and Continuous Tasks, Short Term and Long Term Rewards
- **Bellman Equations**: Deterministic Process, Optimality, Policies, Value functions, State and Action Values
- **Dynamic Programming**: An approach to Optimal Policies with Full Model Knowledge
- **Monte-Carlo Methods** : A Trial and Error approach to Optimal Policies without Model of the World
- **Temporal difference Methods:** An approach to adjust value function and arrive at optimal policy while looking forward in time.
- **Q-learning**
- **Function Approximation**: Feature Construction, NN Learning, Policy Gradient Methods
- **Experimentation with RL systems**
